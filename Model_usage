The Random Forest Regressor is a great choice for demand forecasting due to the following reasons:

✅ Handles Non-Linearity Well
Inventory demand often depends on complex interactions between seasonality, store, and product features.
Random Forest captures these non-linear relationships effectively compared to linear models.

✅ Robust to Outliers & Missing Data
Demand data can have spikes, dips, and missing values.
Unlike linear regression, Random Forest is less sensitive to outliers.

✅ Feature Importance Analysis
It provides a ranking of important features (e.g., store ID, product type, seasonality).
Helps in understanding key drivers of demand.

✅ Handles Categorical & Numerical Data
Can work well with both numerical (sales, day, month) and categorical (store ID, product ID) data without extensive pre-processing.

✅ Scalability & Performance
Works well with large datasets and multiple predictors.
Can be parallelized, making it efficient for production use.
When Not to Use Random Forest?
If the dataset is very large, training time may increase.
If interpretability is a major concern, XGBoost or Linear Regression may be better.
